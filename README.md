### Conditional Formatting (Day 9)
- Format all cells based on their values
- Format only cells that contain specific text, numbers, or dates
- Top/Bottom N ranked values
- Above or below average highlighting
- Duplicate and unique value formatting
- Custom formula-based formatting (e.g., `=A1>100`)

### Advanced Visual Formatting
- 2-Color Scales: Apply gradients between two colors  
- 3-Color Scales: Add a midpoint color to the gradient  
- Data Bars: Visual bars representing value magnitude within cells  
- Icon Sets: Use icons (arrows, flags, etc.) based on cell value thresholds  

### Data Validation
- Restrict inputs using:
  - Drop-down lists (e.g., gender selection)
  - Number ranges
  - Date ranges
  - Custom validation formulas
  - Skip weekends using: `=IF(WEEKDAY(T2,2)>5, T2+2, T2)`
